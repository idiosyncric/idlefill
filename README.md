# idlefill

Run background AI work (job-queue evaluation) on a local LLM server **only when
that server has been idle**, so background work never contends with interactive
traffic.

Two parts:

- **server** — the *arbiter*: a Fastify container that watches the LLM
  gateway's activity feed (+ the inference engine's log mtime), decides when the
  box is idle, and issues/revokes **leases** to registered clients.
- **client** — a Mac daemon (e.g. this machine) that registers with the
  arbiter, asks for a lease for the next job in its queue, runs a project
  executor behind a loopback proxy, and reports usage back. Results land in
  `idlefill/data/` — never in the project repos it works for (career-ops is
  strictly read-only).

## Phase status

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Monorepo, server (Docker), client daemon, career-ops adapter, tests | **Done** — see `npm test`, Docker build |
| 1.5 | Arbiter deployed to **urza** (2026-09-25) | **Done** — `idlefill-server:amd64`, host network, `~/idlefill/data`, token in `~/idlefill/config.json` (0600). Dashboard: `http://100.105.225.1:8787` (unauthenticated — phase-2 middleware gates it). Image built natively on urza: `docker build -t idlefill-server:amd64 server/` (urza is amd64; the Mac's arm64 image won't run there) |
| 2 | urza hardening (compose + traefik route + IP/auth middleware), launchd client, NInfer log ro-mount | **Untested** — artifacts in `deploy/` are clearly marked; nothing there has been exercised by a real deployment |

                                    while lease is active, the arbiter
                                    EXEMPTS this client's tailnet IP
                                    from the idle calculation — and only then
```

**The self-traffic trap (the reason this design exists):** when a backfill
client holds a lease and sends LLM requests, those requests show up in the
activity feed (`src` = the client's IP). If the arbiter counted that traffic,
it would revoke its own lease (starving itself). If it exempted the client
unconditionally, it would flood interactive users. So the exemption applies
**if and only if** the client currently holds an active lease.

## Quickstart (phase 1, local dev)

Prereqs: Node 22+, Docker (for the server image), npm workspaces already
installed (`npm install` at the root).

```bash
npm install            # at the repo root

# 1. Server (Docker)
cd server
cp config.example.json config.json    # set api_tokens to something real
docker build -t idlefill-server:dev ..
docker run --rm --name idlefill-dev \
  -e IDLEFILL_CONFIG="$(cat config.json)" \
  -e IDLEFILL_STATE=./state.json \
  -p 8787:8787 idlefill-server:dev
# (phase 1 dev: -p is for convenience; phase 2 publishes nothing — traefik fronts it)

# 1b. Or run the server directly on the Mac (no Docker):
#   cd server && npx tsx src/index.ts   (reads ./config.json)

# 2. Client (Mac daemon)
cd client
cp config.example.json config.json    # set token to match the server
npm run start                          # tsx src/index.ts

# 3. Build the career-ops job queue (read-only against career-ops)
node scripts/build-careerops-queue.mjs

# 4. Dashboard: open http://127.0.0.1:8787/
```

## Layout

```
server/     arbiter (Docker image) — idle detection, lease state machine,
            Fastify API, WS events, static dashboard
client/     Mac daemon — register, lease loop, loopback proxy, executor
            supervision, usage reporting, crash-safe queue handling
adapters/   per-project executors (career-ops: queue builder + JD evaluator)
scripts/    thin CLI wrappers (build-careerops-queue.mjs)
deploy/     PHASE 2, UNTESTED: compose.yaml, traefik/idlefill.yml, deploy.sh,
            com.sam.idlefill.client.plist
data/       gitignored; queue.jsonl, results.jsonl land here
```

## Auth model

- Every API call and the WS connection must present a token from the server's
- Every API call and the WS connection must present one of the configured tokens (Bearer
- credential header or `token` query parameter).
- Exception (documented, LAN/tailnet-only): the dashboard page (`/`) and
  `GET /api/state` are unauthenticated **read-only** in phase 1. If a request
  to `/api/state` *does* carry a token, a bad one is rejected (401). Phase 2
  adds traefik's `middleware-local-ip-range` in front.

## Operator overrides (pause / force clients)

Per-client, operator-set, persisted in the state file, surfaced on the
dashboard (Clients panel) and in `GET /api/state` (`clients[].override`):

| Override | Effect |
|---|---|
| `pause` | The arbiter refuses **new** leases for that client (reason `client_paused`). A lease already running is NOT revoked — revocation stays driven by idle/preempt/TTL. The client daemon also stops asking for work while paused. |
| `force` | The arbiter grants the client a lease even while the box is **not idle** (bypasses the idle verdict and the post-revocation reidle gate). It does **not** bypass: a degraded signal (activity data unreliable ⇒ never grant), `max_concurrent_leases`, project pause, or the daily budget. The client daemon requests work while forced. |

Overrides optionally carry an `until` (epoch ms) and auto-expire; expired or
orphaned entries are swept on each arbiter tick.

```bash
# token is read at runtime from the gitignored client/server config —
# it never appears on a command line
node scripts/idlefill-control.mjs clients
node scripts/idlefill-control.mjs pause  <name-or-id> [--for 30m]
node scripts/idlefill-control.mjs force  <name-or-id> [--for 30m]
node scripts/idlefill-control.mjs clear  <name-or-id>
```

HTTP equivalent (token-authed): `POST /api/clients/:ref/override` with body
`{"override":"pause"|"force"|null, "until":<epoch_ms>}` — `null` clears.

The dashboard also drives this: the right side of the header is split into
two elements — a color-coded live-state word (`Idle` green / `Busy` amber /
`Running Idle Tasks` blue / `Degraded` red, or `unreachable` when the poll
fails), and to its right the **Engine gate** combobox (`Engine Paused` /
`Engine Running`, one global gate across all clients); each Clients-panel row
has a small per-client one. The state word refreshes every 5s alongside the
rest of the dashboard. Writes are token-authed — paste the arbiter token into
the "gate token" field under the Clients panel once per browser (stored in
`localStorage`, same LAN/tailnet trust posture as the phase-1 dashboard; the
field accepts a clear by emptying it). *Engine Paused* sets the `pause`
override; *Engine Running* clears it and clients run their normal
idle-gated schedule.

## Projects: workers & scheduling (dashboard)

The dashboard's **Projects** panel is the operator view of *who runs what*.
For every project configured in the server's `projects[]` it shows:

- **workers** — the connected clients that reported they are allocated to the
  project (one line each: online dot, name, model, per-job estimate, queued
  jobs),
- **tokens today (UTC)** — the project's output against its `daily_token_cap`,
  with a bar (amber past 80%),
- **schedule** — the knobs that gate the project's grants: the global idle
  threshold (`idle_seconds`), `max_concurrent_leases`, lease TTL, and the
  daily cap.

Workers are **self-reported by the clients** (the arbiter does not infer
allocations): each client daemon re-registers on every poll tick (~20s) with
its project list — `name`, `model`, `estimated_seconds`, and a **live queue
depth** (the arbiter never reads the queue files). The server stores this in
the state file and refreshes `last_seen` on every heartbeat; a worker is
**online** when its heartbeat is <90s old (≈5 daemon polls). Re-registration
stays idempotent by name: same `client_id`, so client overrides (pause/force)
keep sticking across daemon restarts.

In the API: `POST /api/clients/register` accepts an optional
`projects: [{name, model, estimated_seconds, queue_depth}]` (malformed rows
are dropped), and `GET /api/state` / `GET /api/projects` return per-project
`workers: [{client, model, estimated_seconds, queue_depth, online}]` plus a
`scheduling` object (`paused`, `idle_seconds`, `max_concurrent_leases`,
`lease_ttl_seconds`, `daily_token_cap`). A project with no connected workers
shows "no workers connected" — a scheduling row with no executor behind it
tells you the queue will not drain.

## Conventions

See `AGENTS.md`. Short version: Node 22, ESM, `node --test` (run via tsx for
TS), no framework lock-in beyond Fastify, secrets via env/config files that are
gitignored.
